Jim Loiacono on the call\r\nCloud sprawl? SFDC, Workday (SaaS) Kraft Heinz. SAP Ecosystem\r\nNeed to measure latency from cloud to cloud, more to SAP than just SAP.\r\nNeed multi vendor strategy for cloud as well as IT\r\nDo you want SAP to be controlled by the vendor.\r\nThe cloud isnt somewhere else. rise on premise is easier in your own loco.\r\nCost pilke up when you do big interfaces with SAP. (BI warehouse)\r\nequinix Fabric. \r\nInfosys, if engaged with FMI they need to be part of the equation. \r\nMost SI would prefer everyone move to cloud. \r\nCompanies wont go to Rise, They demand what tools you use.\r\nSome customers want to use their own tools and refuse Rise. \r\nMay not be a good fit for InfoSys\r\nSAP team put landmines out for HPE, They are selling as much services as possible\r\nWWT AI Ops, heavily engaged. InfoSys not well know by sales team, considered strong partner.\r\nSAP and InfoSys compete for the same goal. SI will not overlap with a provider. \r\nULTA is tight with InfoSys, \r\nSAP does not run infrastructure well. No eggs in one basket\r\nSAP keeps services but we manage the hardware.\r\nWe dont manage the HW / We provide the HW, SAP manages the HW. \r\nSAP takes control of the compute. Dont care where you have the HW\r\n90% of the SAP reps only get paid on rise, no longer get paid on Licensing\r\nHPE GL prices and configs are set. SAP reps get paid on hardware when using HPE. \r\nIn an ideal world who gets paid on each one of the functions. Hardware? Cloud? Licensing?\r\nFlexible ownership.\r\nMalcolm recap, Rashmi and Malcolm meet with FMI HPE is a leader in SAP solutioning. \r\nWhat are the budget requirements. Money is not an issue.\r\nBig customer are coming out of cloud.\r\nStill running Rise in a colo. Why expose yourself to cloud outages. \r\nInfoSys/ HPE trusted\r\n#1 system Vendor for SAP HANA. \r\nHave the systems but know what to do with them. Why would you pay someone more for SuperDome.\r\nHPE IT Leverages InfoSys for SAP. \r\nS4 is not fully baked, apps are not cloud native. \r\nInfoSys is better group to run RISE, SAP RIse is not an infrastructure team.\r\nHPE/INfoSys/Equinix/GreenLake\r\nUlta Beauty / They are doing what HPE does.\r\nJim in team go through comparison slide\r\nMalcolm can take over with HPE on HPE.\r\nEquinix needs HPE for SAP- International Business Instance\r\nWhy pay money to go between availability zones? They could be Equinix \r\nIt all runs on SuperDome\r\nFMI - Cost has nothing to do with going to Azure. \r\nFMI wants to simplify\r\nKey in on what the differentiators are and what risks / uptime, performance\r\nHow many apps tie into SAP? If you move it what happens?\r\nMeasure latency with remote procedure calls, over 2ms, things break. HPE Prophecy\r\nCloud is not designed for performance, its designed for capacity\r\nOur solution is a private cage. \r\nStorage could be in a different cage or a different zone. HPE its all private\r\nNeed to dive FMI to a workshop, we have to flex our muscles, why wouldnt they look at our solution. \r\nWe have to show our SLA, theirs? 99.5? when you could have much better 99.99. We gave ourselves room\r\n5 nines with superdomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
