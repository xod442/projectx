# Create user credentials
The first time you login, da5id will present a credential page.
Enter your username, and password. da5id will redirect to a page to enter your credentials. It will be saved to system.

These will be your access credentials. This is not a multiuser system...yet.
If you want to change your password, call me :-)

# Inside the app, create companies.
Just add a list of anything here, I use companies I work with.
For personal action items, I just add the word personal to the company tab.

This app is basically worthless unless you add companies.
